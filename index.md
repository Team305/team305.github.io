## [1.0: Team Charter](/TeamCharter)

The vision of Team 305 is to develop a weather monitoring system with the ability to monitor its environment, record & transmit data, and withstand environmental stresses. The project will be completed successfully by meeting the requirements for EGR 314. Additionally, it is Team 305’s main objective to improve our skill sets and encourage the development of new skills - rather than create a product that can be sold. If that ends up being accomplished - fantastic - however that is not Team 305’s primary goal.

This product will be unique by utilizing two serial sensors and a motor-controlled actuator communicating through I2C or SPI. A successful project will be fully functional, simplistic in design, reliable, and cost effective.

## [2.0: Generating User Needs and Product Requirements](/UserNeeds)

After establishing Team 305’s mission and charter, the group moved onto product research establishing user needs and requirements for the product. Team 305 was able to gather user comments and needs directly from the competition by products that are currently available. From these needs and those generated by team members, a clear list of users needs was identified and organized.

These organized needs and the course requirements allowed for Team 305 to develop a clear perspective of the overall product requirement needed. Specifications and aspects for Team 305’s concept were developed by identifying critical requirements specified by users and our own ideas about what features should be included. For example, almost every user specified explicitly that the weather station was easy to use. With this kind of information Team 305 was able to make a clear list of the product requirements. 

## [3.0: Product Requirements](/ProductRequirements)

EGR 314 students were given the task of working in groups of four to develop a mobile weather station that will be displayed at the Innovation Showcase on April 28, 2023. Each team had the flexibility to select a minimum of two serial sensors and a minimum of one actuator that uses an I2C or SPI-based interface. It is crucial that the class develops original concepts that are not copies of already-existing ones. The following are some suggestions for the class’s possible serial sensors: temperature, humidity, light, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. Solar panels, fan controllers, and humidity control are a few ideas for an actuator that may be controlled to react in a certain way.

## [4.0: Design Ideation](/DesignIdeation)

From the generated user needs and product requirements, Team 305 was able to begin design ideation and concept generation. Each member contributed equally to idea generation, though due to time constraints it was completed individually rather than as a group. The first iteration of ideas was completed using a “shotgun” approach, where any and all ideas were placed into a list - as long as they were relevant to the group charter and mission statement. There was no need to brainstorm once the list was approaching ~100 ideas. 

From there, ranking, organizing, and idea recombination was possible. It was completed by creating a ranking system and placing the rank on each sticky note. A rank of 5 was deemed to be most important, while a rank of 1 was decided to be least important. The ranks allowed each group member to take the highest ranked features and group them into a concept “bin”. Each bin was then sketching into a concept. Concept 1 was sketched by Aaron K., Concept 2 was sketched by Kevin H., and Concept 3 was sketched by Tristan D.

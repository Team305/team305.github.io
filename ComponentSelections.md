## Temperature Sensor

### Optimal Solution: TC74A4-3.3VCTTR
When selecting a temperature sensor, Option 1 is best for Team 305. The reason for that is because it checks off all the necessary requirements needed for a temperature sensor. It is a digital sensor, I2C compatible, and it runs off low power. Team 305 must pay attention and use as little power as we can when choosing a component. Option 1 is also available to Team 305 as a through hole component, which allows us to test it before PCB design.

## Light Sensor

### Optimal Solution: AS7343L-DLGM
Option 1 is the best choice for Team 305 - mainly for broad spectrum capabilities, supply voltage range, and method of communication (I2C). The data sheet is very descriptive and provides users with application notes, detailed diagrams, code examples, detailed pin readout, and lots of other well documented information that is pertinent to Team 305â€™s application. While it does have considerably small dimensions, it was one of the only sensors that fit all the needs of Team 305. Option 3 is almost the exact same chip - however Option 3 has an additional channel dedicated to a wavelength that Team 305 is not interested in measuring. For these reasons Team 305 feels that Option 1 will suffice to meet project requirements, which has less channels than Option 3. 

## Motor Controller 

### Optimal Solution: IFX9201SGAUMA1
For the motor controller the optimal solution is the IFX9201SGAUMA1. This is because it is the controller we will be working with in class and it allows for all the key features needed from this part. Its ability to be powered by a 3V supply is also a huge advantage compared to the other controllers. Overall this option is the best choice.

## Motor

### Optimal Solution: 1568-ROB-15277-ND SparkFun Electronics
The best component found for the motor was the 1568-ROB-15277-ND SparkFun Electronics. This high torque motor will allow for the movement aspect of our project to work efficiently. This is a very cost effective motor that has lots of information scattered across the web in case there is any need for assistance. The gear box inside allows for slow and precise movement of objects that have some weight to them. Overall with its ability to be powered by the 9V main supply and high torque for cost and size this motor is the best option. 

## Linear + Switching Regulator

### Optimal Solution: LM2575S-3.3/NOPB
The LM2575S-3.3/NOPB is the ideal choice for Team 305 because of its ease of use, high stock at Mouser, and non-excessive features. Compared to the other options, Option 3 does not have features that Team 305 does not plan to use. Additionally - Option 3 has the desired current and voltage output to power the PIC MCU (3.3 V) and the motor chosen above. 

## AC-DC Wall adapter

### Optimal Solution: B09YRGM86T
The B09YRGM86T is the ideal choice for Team 305 because of its lower cost and ability to power all necessary systems effectively. The other options are either too high or low in current and voltage output making the choice clear. Option 3 is also the most cost effective allowing for the team to spend money elsewhere.

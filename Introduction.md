# 1.0 Introduction

EGR 314 Students were given the task of working in groups of four to develop a mobile weather station that will be displayed at the Innovation Showcase on April 28, 2023. Each team had the flexibility to select a minimum of two serial sensors and a minimum of one actuator that uses an I2C or SPI-based interface. The borad goal is that each team develops original concepts that are not copies of exisiting products. The possible serial sensors many include temperature, humidity, light, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. Solar panels, fan controllers, and humidity control.

In an effort to design a reliable weather monitoring system that is capable of monitoring its surroundings, recording and transmitting data, and resisting environmental wear - Team 305 began the project by setting broad goals. The primary goals of Team 305 are to meet the requirements of EGR 314, while also working towards improving our skill sets and learning new skills. Although selling the final product would be great, it is not the primary focus of the team. Team 305 has established that the finished product is non-competitive and is purely an academic exercise for the purposes of EGR 314. 

In summary, Team 305’s weather monitoring system is unique and uses solutions that utilizes the latest technology to produce accurate and dependable data, while being cost effective. The weather monitoring system designed utilizes two serial sensors and a motor controlled actuator that communicate using I2C/SPI protocols. The product designed is fully operational and cost effective. Overall the original goals of the project were met - which included creating a functional product, improving the aesthetics of the finished product, meet EGR 314 goals and requirements, enhance each team member’s skills, encourage skill development, and implement a cost effective design.

# 5.0 Selected Design
## 5.1 Current Ideation
The current design features a custom 3D printed rail mounting system. The inner piece of the assembly will have a temperature and light sensor mounted to it. This piece slides freely within the outer sleeve. The outer sleeve is meant to hold the moving pieces and will be fixed to the motor. When the motor turns the shaft and gear - the grooved inner piece will move, while the motor and outer sleeve remain fixed to eachother.

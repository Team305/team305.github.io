## Appendix A: Communication Procedures 
For communication, our team will primarily be using text messages to ensure that we are all on the same page with the project. This will allow for quick and reliable messages allowing efficient communication. Team meetings will be conducted on Discord, as it allows for easy screen and file sharing so we are able to complete our meeting’s goals effectively. Email will be used as a last resort in the case one of the team members does not respond with the other two communication channels.

The team will use Google Drive and its applications to live-edit documents as a group. Google automatically tracks activity and edits by group members, and we decided that is the best way to work on a single document simultaneously.

Either of the group leaders will communicate  with the instructor and relay information back to the group. In case one leader is absent - the other will absorb the responsibilities. The entire group is responsible for communicating effectively with each other.

### Meeting Coordination
Based on each team member’s given availability, the times of Sunday from 1-3 pm, Monday from 4-6 pm, and Wednesday from 4-6 pm suffice for holding team meetings. The Meeting Coordinator and recorder will be responsible for ensuring that everyone is aware of meeting times and places. This document will be used as a reference for when Team Members are available.

The Meeting Coordinator member will also be responsible for reminding the group of meeting times and adjusting meeting times if needed. Meetings will be conducted on Discord until physical meetings are necessary, in order to allow the whole team to remain on the same page for this project. If the Meeting Leaders are not available it is the responsibility of the Project Monitor to ensure that the group is informed of what the scheduled meeting time is.

### Team Coordination
The Assignment Leader will be submitting the assignments. Each member will review the assignment and agree it is ready to be submitted. Once the team has agreed that a document is ready for submission - the Assignment Leader will prepare the final document and confirm submission over discord. 

Each team member will make an effort to prepare for each assignment. The team will assist and educate a member if they are having knowledge or skill problems. It is part of Team 305’s shared goal, as mentioned in the Charter Section of this document, to learn new skills and teach each other what we already know. Team 305 is confident in our current skills and our ability to complete EGR 314 objectives on time. 

The Assignment Leader will communicate the feedback given from the grading team or professor. The team will then take collective action to implement the feedback and improve documents going forward.

### Roles and Responsibilities
#### Table AD: Roles and Responsibilities

| Team member    | Role              | Duties                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mark Alvarez   | Meeting leader    | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting                                        |
| Aaron Karsten  | Meeting recorder  | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned                          |
| Tristan Dunton | Assignment leader | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date                                                           |
| Kevin Hays     | Project monitor   | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |

Group 305 is focused on creating an environment where each team member can grow their engineering skill set. To help ensure that this process is successful each team member was assigned a role with general responsibilities. Each team member expressed their preference regarding role assignments. It was relatively easy for each member of Team 305 to agree. If a team member feels that the current role assigned is not right it is expected they communicate this with the team going forward. Technical responsibilities have been assigned loosely, but it is the shared goal of Team 305 to impart what each member knows to one another. This task should not interfere with timelines that we establish to meet EGR 314 deadlines.

If anyone is not available it is the Assignment Leader’s responsibility to make up for the missing members work when acceptable, as well as informing the absent member of what is going on within the group. It is critical to the team's success that each individual is held accountable. Constant dialogue within the team is critical to ensure that meeting times are acceptable. To ensure this - both the Meeting Recorder and Leader must be active and consistently disseminating information within the team. It is the Project Monitor's responsibility to ensure the group and its individuals are on track.

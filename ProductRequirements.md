# 3.0 Product Requirements

## 3.1 Objective

Team 305’s objective is to design a reliable weather monitoring system that is capable of monitoring its surroundings, recording and transmitting data, and resisting environmental wear. The primary goals of Team 305 are to meet the requirements of EGR 314, while also working towards improving our skill sets and learning new skills. Although selling the final product would be great, it is not the primary focus of the team. Team 305 has established that the finished product is non-competitive and is purely an academic exercise for the purposes of EGR 314. 

The weather monitoring system developed by Team 305 will be one-of-a-kind by utilizing two serial sensors and a motor controlled actuator that communicate through I2C or SPI. A successful project will be fully operational, streamlined in design, dependable, and cost effective.

Our goals include: creating a fully operational product that ensures all sensors and components function as intended, giving the product a professional appearance, meeting all EGR 314 goals and requirements, enhancing each team member’s skills and encouraging skill development, and designing a cost effective and uncomplicated product.

In summary, Team 305’s weather monitoring system will be unique and use solutions that utilizes the latest technology to produce accurate and dependable data, while being cost effective and user friendly. Team 305 hopes to place this product in greenhouses since they think it will significantly benefit greenhouses and the plants grown there.

## 3.2 Stakeholders

Due to the non-competitive nature of this group stakeholders are limited to ASU affiliates, including involved students, professors, and potential private interests. 

**Target Group:** Commercial and hobbyist growers.

**Target Purchaser/User:** Residential and commercial greenhouse or grow tent users.

**Regulatory instances:** Meet EGR 314 Spring 2023 requirements and ASU Code of Conduct for Engineers.

## 3.3 Use Cases

**User #1: Rick**

Rick is a 30 year old homeowner who lives in Phoenix, Arizona. Since the temperatures in Arizona are harsh he decided to build a greenhouse in his backyard. He uses Team 305’s weather control module to regulate his greenhouse’s temperature and light levels so that he can achieve the best possible plant development. On his smartphone, Rick launches the weather app of Team 305 and checks the most recent data on the conditions within the greenhouse. The temperature and light parameters can then be adjusted based on his data monitoring to the values he desires.

**User #2:  Samantha**

Samantha is a young adult who is 25 and currently works at “Living Carbon”. This company is located in San Francisco, California. Samantha's position is called plant care associate and she is in charge of research and growth in greenhouses. Her new project is to test out Team 305’s weather control module. She will alter the temperature and light levels to see how well the sensors are performing. With this weather control module she can use the Wi-Fi controlled app that will send live data in the greenhouse conditions. Samantha can monitor the data remotely in this way.

## 3.5 Open Questions

1. When creating the weather module, how accurate can we make the sensors using the components we have?

2. How will we calibrate the sensors initially?

3. Does the Motors motion need to be directly visible?

4. What are sensors that would not be recommended for use in this case?

5. What is the expected life span of the sensors on average?
